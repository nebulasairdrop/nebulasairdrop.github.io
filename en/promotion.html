<h1>Nebula Airdrop Promotion Program</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In order to promote the usage of Nebula Airdrop and win the highest bonus of the Nebula Incentive Program, we have conducted a complete promotion plan. In line with the incentive cycle of the Nebula Incentive Program, we will set an airdrop on the site in the following week. Airdrop tokens are used to calculate the dividends. The funds come from the bonuses that the Nebula dropped during the week in the Nebula Incentive Program. At the same time, if we get the reward for the best application of the month, then the total amount of airdrop token in the four weeks of the month will be combined for additional dividends.</p>

<h4>Rules</h4>

<p>We award users who participating in the Nebula Airdrop in a period at most 20% of bonus of the period.</p>

<p>Assume that the abbreviation for the airdrop token is NPT（NASPromotionToken）</p>

<ol>
	<li>Each address can only gets once in an airdrop；</li>
	<li>Each address can get 100 NPT basically；</li>
	<li>You can get extra 40 NPT by filling in a valid referrer's address；</li>
	<li>Every time your friend successfully received an airdrop using your referrer's address, you can get extra 40NPT；</li>
	<li>After the end of one period, after the Nebula Airdrop has received the official reward of the NAS (at 24:00 on Friday, the second week), we will automatically distribute the dividends in this period to all users participating in the airdrop within 2 days.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Dividend Distribution Algorithm</h4>

<p>The dividend distribution algorithm in each bonus period is as follows:</p>

<p>Assume that during one period, the Nebula Airdrop acquired N NAS coins in the Nebula Incentive Program, the total supply of airdrop tokens is M, and the baseline is B=100000. The value of each token is:</p>

<p>NPT = 0.2 * N / (B+ M) NAS</p>

<p>The above formula has the following rules:</p>

<ol>
	<li>In each period, as the total number of airdrop tokens increases, the proportion of bonuses used to reward users also increases. When the total number of airdrop tokens is equal to baseline B, the ratio is 10%. As the total number increases infinitely, the proportion becomes close to 20%. Users need to actively promote in order to obtain a larger proportion of rewards;</li>
	<li>The user may create a batch of addresses to get airdrops, but this action lowers the unit value of the NPT, and consider that each transaction needs to pay a $0.15-$0.3 fee, so when the value of token in a airdrop  is less than transaction fees, the user will consider this action is a uneconomical behavior, and cheating cannot continue to exist;</li>
	<li>The spontaneous cheating airdrops and spreading by users may help the Nebulas Airdrop to win a higher reward, but the low balance accounts getting airdrops may not help the nebula airdrop.</li>
</ol>
